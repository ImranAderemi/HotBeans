In year 12, as part of my IT course, I was tasked with creating a webpage with only a brief description of what the website should include and depict. The only information about HotBeans that I was given was that it's a web development company, and they're looking to hire a new junior web developer.

So over a period of 2-weeks, I had to teach myself the basics of HTML, then CSS and Javascript. I primarily used a combination of YouTube tutorials Reddit and Stack Overflow.
